# Stroke_Detection

A brain stroke is characterized by cell deaths due to poor blood flow, which can lead to permanent damage on specific brain areas and improper functioning.
A stroke can be distinguished between two types: ischemic, due to lack of blood flow, and hemorrhagic, due to bleeding.
The effects of a stroke can be perceived as soon as it occurs and its symptoms can include numbness or weakness in the face, arm, or leg, especially on one side of the body, sudden severe headache, difficulty in seeing in one or both eyes or trouble speaking.

According to Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 795,000 people in the United States have a stroke on each year, leading to a high death rate, where, on 2020 alone, 1 in 6 deaths from cardiovascular disease were due it.
About 87% of all strokes occur due the blockade of blood flow to the brain, distinguishing it as an ischemic stroke.

On this project, we aim to build a ML model to predict a stroke occurrence based on key factors.
